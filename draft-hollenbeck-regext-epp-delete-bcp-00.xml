            <t>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes commands for clients to delete
                domain and host objects, both of which are used to publish information in the Domain
                Name System (DNS). EPP includes guidance concerning those deletions that is intended
                to avoid DNS resolution disruptions and maintain data consistency. However,
                operational relationships between objects can make that guidance difficult to
                implement. Some EPP clients have developed operational practices to delete those
                objects that have unintended impacts on DNS resolution and security. This document
                describes best practices to delete domain and host objects that reduce the risk of
                DNS resolution failure and maintain client-server data consistency.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>Section 3.2.2 of RFC 5731 <xref target="RFC5731" /> contains text that has led some
                domain name registrars (acting as EPP clients) to adopt an operational practice of
                re-naming name server host objects so that they can delete domain objects:</t>
            <t>"A domain object SHOULD NOT be deleted if subordinate host objects are associated
                with the domain object. For example, if domain "example.com" exists and host object
                "ns1.example.com" also exists, then domain "example.com" SHOULD NOT be deleted until
                host "ns1.example.com" has either been deleted or renamed to exist in a different
                superordinate domain."</t>
            <t>Similarly, Section 3.2.2 of RFC 5732 <xref target="RFC5732" /> contains this text
                regarding deletion of host objects:</t>
            <t>"A host name object SHOULD NOT be deleted if the host object is associated with any
                other object. For example, if the host object is associated with a domain object,
                the host object SHOULD NOT be deleted until the existing association has been
                broken. Deleting a host object without first breaking existing associations can
                cause DNS resolution failure for domain objects that refer to the deleted host
                object."</t>
            <t>These recommendations create a dilemma when the sponsoring client for "example.com"
                intends to delete "example.com" but its associated host object "ns1.example.com" is
                also associated with domain objects sponsored by another client. It is advised not
                to delete the host object due to its associated domain objects. However, the
                associated domain objects cannot be directly updated because they are sponsored by
                another client.</t>
            <t>Section 3.2.5 of RFC 5732 <xref target="RFC5732" /> describes host object renaming:</t>
            <t>"Host name changes can have an impact on associated objects that refer to the host
                object. A host name change SHOULD NOT require additional updates of associated
                objects to preserve existing associations, with one exception: changing an external
                host object that has associations with objects that are sponsored by a different
                client. Attempts to update such hosts directly MUST fail with EPP error code 2305.
                The change can be provisioned by creating a new external host with a new name and
                any needed new attributes, and subsequently updating the other objects sponsored by
                the client."</t>
            <t>Section 1.1 of RFC 5732 includes a description of external hosts. Note that the specific method
			    used to rename the host object can introduce risks of lame delegation (see
                Section 2.8 of RFC 1912 <xref target="RFC1912" />). If the new external host refers
                to an unregistered domain, then a malicious actor may register the domain and create the
                host object to gain control of DNS resolution for the domain previously associated with
                "ns1.example.com". If the new external host offers an authoritative DNS service but
                the domain is not assigned to an account, then a malicious actor may add the domain to a
                service account and gain control of (hijack) DNS resolution functionality. If the new external host
                offers recursive DNS service or no DNS service, then DNS requests for the domain
                will result in SERVFAIL messages or other errors. Aggressive re-queries by DNS
                resolvers may then create large numbers of spurious DNS queries for an unresolvable
                domain. Note that renaming a host object to a name of an external host is an operation
				that might not be possible to reverse.</t>
            <t>This document describes the rationale for the "SHOULD NOT be deleted" text, the risk
                associated with host object renaming, and the best practices that can be used to
                mitigate that risk.</t>

            <section anchor="dns-cons" title="DNS Considerations">
                <t>The primary consideration when deleting domain and host objects concerns the
                    potential impact on DNS resolution. Deletion of a domain object will make all
                    name servers associated with subordinate host objects unresolvable. Deletion of
                    a host object will make any domain that has been delegated to the associated
                    name server unresolvable. The text in RFCs 5731 and 5732 was written to
                    encourage clients to take singular, discrete steps to delete objects in a way
                    that avoids breaking DNS resolution functionality. Additionally, allowing host
					objects to exist after deletion of their superordinate domain object invites
					hijacking, as a malicious actor may re-register the domain object, potentially
					controlling resolution for the host objects and for their associated domain objects.</t>
            </section>
            <section anchor="client-server-cons" title="Client-Server Consistency Considerations">
                <t>A server that implicitly deletes subordinate host objects in response to a
                    request to delete a domain object can create a data inconsistency condition in
                    which the EPP client and the EPP server have different views of what remains
                    registered after processing a &lt;delete&gt; command. The text in RFCs 5731 and
                    5732 was written to encourage clients to take singular, discrete steps to delete
                    objects in a way that maintains client-server data consistency.</t>

                <t>Implementations of EPP can have dependencies on the hierarchical domain
                    object/host object relationship, as can exist in a relational database. In such
                    instances, deletion of a domain object without addressing the existing
                    subordinate host objects can cause relational consistency and integrity issues.
                    The text in RFCs 5731 and 5732 was written to reduce the risk of these issues
                    arising as a result of implicit object deletion.</t>

        <section anchor="renaming-risk" title="Host Object Renaming Risk">
            <t>As described in RFC 5731, it's possible to delete a domain object that has associated
                host objects that are managed by other clients by renaming the host object to exist
                in a different superordinate domain. This is commonly required when the sponsoring
                client is unable to disassociate a host object from a domain object managed by
                another client because only the second client is authorized to make changes to their
                domain object and the EPP server requires host object disassociation to process a
                request to delete a domain object. For example:</t>
            <t>Domain object "domain1.example" is registered by ClientX.</t>
            <t>Domain object "domain2.example" is registered by ClientY.</t>
            <t>Subordinate host object "ns1.domain1.example" is registered by ClientX.</t>
            <t>Host object "ns1.domain1.example" is associated with domain object "domain1.example" by
                ClientX.</t>
            <t>Host object "ns1.domain1.example" is associated with domain object "domain2.example" by
                ClientY.</t>
            <t>ClientX wishes to delete domain object "domain1.example". It can modify domain object
                "domain1.example" to remove the association of host object "ns1.domain1.example", but
                ClientX cannot remove the association of host object "ns1.domain1.example" from domain
                object "domain2.example" because "domain2.example" is sponsored by ClientY and ClientX is unable to determine that relationship. Only ClientY can
                modify domain object "domain2.example", and if they do not do so ClientX will need to
                rename host object "ns1.domain1.example" so that "domain1.example" can be deleted.</t>
            <t>ClientX renames host object "ns1.domain1.example" to "ns1.example.org", creating an
                external host and meeting the EPP server's subordinate host object disassociation requirement.</t>
            <t>If domain "example.org" does not exist, this practice introduces a risk of DNS
                resolution hijacking if someone were to register the "example.org" domain and create a subordinate
                host object named "ns1.example.org". That name server would receive DNS queries for
                all domains delegated to it, allowing the operator of the name server to respond in
                potentially malicious ways.</t>

                    names (e.g., "ns1.example.com" to "ns1.example.org") or a non-existent parent domain in the authoritative repository (e.g., ".org"). EPP servers might not
                    confirm that these hosts exist, are resolvable, or offer authoritative service
                    for associated domains. Research <xref target="risky-bizness" /> has described
                    how malicious actors have registered these parent domains and created child host objects to take

                    pseudo-TLD <xref target="risky-bizness-irtf" />. However, the ".alt" pseudo-TLD is intended

                    servers SHOULD NOT deliberately add name server entries for non-DNS labels. These

			  EPP client for DNS resolution may be protected from hijacking through the use of DNSSEC. Their
			  resolution may be protected from the effects of deletion by using host objects associated with
			  multiple domain objects. DNSSEC and multiple host objects may interfere with the use of controlled
			  interruption IP addresses to alert registrants to DNS changes. EPP clients can periodically scan
			  sponsored domains for association with sacrificial name servers and alert end users concerning those domains.</t>
